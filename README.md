# A Few Notes About the Project
An instructional project from the Scrimba React course.

I chose to recreate in Visual Studio Code rather than complete in the Scrimba editor for future reference in 1) GitHub given the issue below, 2) instructional comments, 3) CSS not rendering as expected.

One dependency, `react-split-pane` is no longer being maintained. I searched the NPM error message and found this discussion https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/5376 and added the files into my project. This was new learning for me as well as using polyfill.

`localStorage`

side effects use

when the app compiles it shows warnings that can be turned off with performance hints in webpack (2 screenshots to insert)
